# TriviaGame
-What the project does

This game runs a series of questions, in which you have 5 seconds to select and answer and move on to the next question. At the end of the game you get your score returned and can restart if you wish.

-Why the project is useful

Building the game implemented the use of timers, as well as continued use of displaying and hiding elements. The use of objects and storing values, and comparing them against correct answers stored in the array. It was good practice trying to implement all of these things together.

-How users can get started with the project

Start with file creation of HTML, CSS, and JS files. Create basic format for HTML and link necessary files, bootstrap and jquery. I recommend beginning with the javascript file after that. Build timer function and then the logic of the game. Necessary variables, and a basic set of a few questions in an array to ensure the game is working. Make sure to utilize console log for debugging and make sure that each function is outputting the way that it should. Pseudocode areas that are troublesome so you can break down problems into sections to be worked on. Save and commit often to prevent running into further issues. 

-Where users can get help with your project

Users can reference Youtube, and github for similar projects. Also reference jquery website for functions, and CSS animations to make the site look presentable. Bootstrap also can help with basic layout if you do not want to build the containers yourself.
